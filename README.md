# MNIST-Dataset

## Introduction

This analysis was part of a graduate level machine learning course at Kent State University. The main goal of the project was to analyse the MNIST dataset and perform PCA and visualize the different principal components and the amount of information they each contain.
Additionally, principle components were used to train a machine learning model that was used to classify the hand-written images into digits ranging from 0-9.

## Tools and methods used

The tools that were used during this project are:
1. Python libraries such as Tensorflow, Keras, Pandas, Matplotlib...
2. Machine learning techniques such as SVM classifier and Principle Component Analysis.

## Findings

By the end of the project we were able to boil down the number of principle components into 10, which were used to classify the handwritten images in the MNIST dataset. We also visualized the amount of information stored in each principle component which led us to choose 10 as an optimal number. Furthermore, we calculated the mean of a random image from the dataset and visualized it. Finally, we visualized digits when they were reduced to 1 up to 10 principle components to highlight the differences.
